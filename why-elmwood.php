        <p>We are a group of professionals with extensive experience in various fields of accounting. Our experiences also vary from Multi-National Companies as well as Small and Medium Enterprises of different industries.</p>
        <p>As much as possible, we would retrieve files for accounting when convenient for our clients so that accounting and bookkeeping matters can be kept up to date, even if the filing dates are not approaching. This will help us maintain accounts in an organised manner, from which data could be retrieved at a moments notice. It also mitigates risks of late filings when the regulatory authorities require them.</p>

        <img src="/img/whylmw/about1.png" alt="">
        <p>As an added service to our clients, we will also make certain to arrange a meeting after the closing of a financial year to go through the financial report generated as per the accounts of the client in that financial year. This will put both the management team of the client as well as our own accounting team on the same page as to the financial well-being and accounting practice of the client.</p>
        <p>In addition to the service we provide, we have faith in our team’s extensive experiences in different fields. Our team of Chartered Accountants former partners of large accounting firms, bring to the table not just proficiency in accounting, but also experience in different industries.</p>
        <p>Since Elmwood is still nascent as a firm in the industry, we are able to offer our clients a competitive rate for our services. In so doing, we are able to efficiently and cost-effectively provide an accounting service to our clients – a win-win situation for both our clients and Elmwood.</p>
